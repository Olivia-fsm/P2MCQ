# T5-Negation

We apply the ***CrossAUG*** model provided by ([Lee et al., 2021](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3459637.3482078)). The checkpoint could be downloaded here.

The negation of the sentence could be generated by the following code:

```bash
python /subtasks/T5-Negation/task5_gen.py --task1_out_path <task1_output path> --output_path <output path> --verbose True
```
